### Development Planes

In order to design and create the application, the developer distinguished the required functionality of the site and how it would answer the user stories, as described above, using the **Five Development Planes**:

<strong>1. <u>Strategy</u></strong>

Broken into three categories, the website will focus on the following target audiences:
- **Roles:**
     - Prospective Senior Members/Junior Members
     - Current Senior Members/Junior Members

With these goals in mind, a strategy table was created to determine the trade-off between importance and viability with the following results:

<strong>3. <u>Structure</u></strong>

The website's navigation was organized in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results: 


<div align='center'align='center'>
<strong>Navigation Structure for User Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/user-mgmt-ia.png" alt="User Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<div align='center'align='center'>
<strong>Navigation Structure for Product Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/product-mgmt-ia.png" alt="Product Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<div align='center'align='center'>
<strong>Navigation Structure for Transaction Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/transaction-mgmt-ia.png" alt="Transaction Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<strong>4. <u>Skeleton</u></strong>

Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/h1ntD5dJMvQHQBXjngttOe/St-Saviours-OBA "Link to St Saviours OBA Workspace") with providing a positive user experience in mind:

<strong>5. <u>Surface</u></strong>

- <strong>Colour Scheme</strong>

     - The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected to match our colors at St Saviours OBA. Black and yellow are our primary colours, their clash represents the combatitve nature of the sport.

     - The indigo, purple and heliotrope are used to provide user feedback in relation to the shopping cart feature and payment system.

<div align='center'>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/st-saviours-oba-cp.png" alt="St Saviours OBA Colour Palette" />
</div>

- <strong>Typography</strong>

     - The primary font for this website is [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald "Link to Oswald Google Fonts page"). It was chosen for its old-school, classic look which fits St Saviours OBA as an old, inner city boxing club.

          ![Oswald Typography Example](markdown-files/readme-files/oswald.png)

     - The secondary font used is [Playball](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playball "Link to Playball Google Fonts page"). It's a similar old-school font with more overt sporty overtones, and works really well for headings and titles.

          ![Playball Typography Example](markdown-files/readme-files/playball.png)


- <strong>Imagery</strong>

     - The imagery used on this web app was purchased from [Canva](https://canva.com/ "Link to Canva") by the developer using a Canva Pro License, or provided to the developer by St Saviours OBA eg. the logo below

     ![St Saviours OBA Logo](markdown-files/readme-files/logo.png)

- <strong>Icons</strong>

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the source of all icons used throughout this web app.

## Information Architecture

### Database
- During development, a single-database was setup using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html "Link to SQLite site") as this is included and did not require any further installation to support.
- Upon deployment, [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres "Link to Heroku Postgres site") was used, as this is an add-on service provided by Heroku.

### Data Models
<div align='center'>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/models.png" alt="Lato Typography" />
</div>

*model diagram created using [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/ "DrawSQL page")*

Unless otherwise stated, the default validation settings of `blank=False, null=False` are assumed.

#### User Model

For this app I created a custom User Model following [this guide in the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-a-custom-user-model) and [this tutorial by CodingWithMitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeRC7E8Z7Y).

This made it easy to add custom user fields, and have login based on email as opposed to an unneccessary username being used within model

#### Accounts App

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the St Saviours OBA website features a consistently responsive and intuitive naviational system:

#### Navbar
- Users will find a **navbar** conventionally placed on the top of each page. Navigational links are identifiable and accessible, and the club logo redirects users to the home page.
- The navbar utilises **dropdown** menus for cleaner design.
- If the user is in session, an additional dropdown menu provides users with account functionality.
- On mobile and tablet devices, the navigation menu collapses into a **hamburger** menu on top left for a cleaner design.
- The shopping bag icon to top right is designed quick and convenient access to items selected for secure checked out.
- **Toasts** are displayed under the navbar, providing users with realtime feedback on their actions.

#### Footer
- The **footer** contains links for users to navigate to their preferred location with ease.
- The links are divided into appropriate categories, allowing users to choose precisely where they'd like to visit, and displaying the extent of options available to them.
- These links are displayed in four columns on large and medium devices, and single columns on small.
- The footer also provides the Club **social links** and **copyright** information.
     - Link to Club Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok.
     - Mailto link to club emails

#### Page Layout

- A banner title is provided on each page to help users to quickly determine their location
- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/ "Link to Jinja docs") was used to extend the base.html page, allowing for the utmost consistency and preservation of functionality across all pages. The extended block elements created the same basic layout for each page:

     ```
     <nav>
          <!-- Navigational content -->
     </nav>

     {% block messages %}
          <!-- Appropriate toast messages -->
     {% endblock %}

     {% block content %}
          <!-- Content unique to each page -->
     {% endblock %}

     <footer>
          <!-- Footer content -->
     </footer>
     ```

### Local Deployment

Once a local clone is created, follow the below steps to deploy locally:
1. Install all project requirments using the below command in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
2. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project's root directory.
3. Create an `env.py` file in the root directory.
4. Add `env.py` to the `.gitignore` file.
5. Within the `env.py` file, enter the project's environment variables:
     ```
     import os

     os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", <your_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", <your_key>)
     os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", <your_key>)
     ```
     - A secret key can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)*

     - Stripe Public and Secret keys can be generated after Stripe account signup. Keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'

     - Webhook key (WH) can be generated under 'Developers' section of your stripe Dashboard. Select 'Add endpoint' and enter:*

     ```
     https://<yourhosturl>/checkout/wh/
     ```

     - Select 'Receive All Events' and 'Add Endpoint' and view your 'signing secret' 

6. Migrations will need to be made to create the local database and can be done using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py makemigrations
     ```
     ```
     python3 manage.py migrate
     ```
7. Next, you will need to import the db.json file found in the `Pages` and `Shop` apps. The `JSON` file contains all data needed to host the database and can be imported using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py loaddata db.json     
     ```

8. A `superuser` will needed to be created to gain access to the Django Admin Page and can be created using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
9. Launch the project server using the below command in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py runserver
     ```
10. A server should be running locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. In running the server, a new SQLite3 database file (`db.sqlite3`) will be created in the root directory.

*Once this is complete, the project should run within your local development environment.*

### Heroku App Creation
The website requires back-end technology, including a server, application and database. It is because of this that the project was deployed on **Heroku**, a container-based cloud Platform as a Service. There are two ways to deploy on Heroku:

- Using the Heroku Command Line Interface
- Connect to GitHub Repository (the developer recommends this method)

**Create Heroku App**
1. Log into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku login page") or [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/login "Link to Heroku sign-up page").
2. Select the `New` button on the top-right of the page, and choose `Create New App`. Give your app a unique name (something that is the same, or similar to, your Django App) and set the region (in this instance: **Europe**). Then click `Create App`.
3. Navigate to the `Deploy` tab on the dashboard and select `Connect to GitHub`.
4. Search for the repository name (ensuring it is spelled correctly). Once located, click `Connect`. 

**Create PostgreSQL Database**
1. On the Heroku dashboard, navigate to `Resources` section.
2. In the search bar, enter `postgres` and select `Heroku Postgres`.
3. For this project, the plan name os `Hobby Dev - Free`, but feel free to select your own.
4. Once a plan is selected, `Submit Order Form`.

**Configure Heroku Variables**
1. On the Heroku dashboard, navigate to `Settings` and locate `Reveal Config Vars` button to set the following necessary variables for the project (Note: You may not have all variable values yet, add the ones that you have available and add the others in due course):

     | Key      | Value  |
     |--------------|--------------|
     | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `Your AWS Access Key` |
     | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `Your AWS Secret Access Key` |
     | DATABASE_URL | `Your Database URL` |
     | EMAIL_PASS | `Your Email Password` |
     | EMAIL_USER | `Your Email Address`|
     | SECRET_KEY | `Your Secret Key` |
     | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `Your Stripe Public Key` |
     | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `Your Stripe Secret Key` |
     | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `Your Stripe WH Key` |
     | USE_AWS | `TRUE` |
     ***Ensure all values are the same as the values set in your `env.py` file***

2. Navigate back to the `Deploy` tab and scroll down to `Automatic Deploys`.
3. Ensure that the `master` branch is selected, then select `Enable Automatic Deploys`.

**Configure PostgreSQL Database**
1. In the project CLI, install the following dependancies to use Postgres:
     ```
     pip3 install dj_database_url
     ```
     ```
     pip3 install psycopg2_binary
     ```
     ```
     pip3 install gunicorn
     ```
2. Freeze new dependancies using `$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
3. Create a `Procfile` file so that Heroku knows which file runs the app. In the terminal window, type the following command:
     ```
     $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile
     ```
     *Remove the blank line that may occur at the end of the Procfile to avoid any issues*
4. Push the two files to the repository:
     ```
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m "Commit Message"
     $ git push
     ```
5. In the project's `settings.py` file:
     - Add `import dj_database_url` to imports section (top)
     - Locate `DATABASES` constant variable within the file and replace it with the following:
          ```
          if "DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
               DATABASES = {"default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ ["DATABASE_URL"])}
          else:
               DATABASES = {
               "default": {
                    "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
                    "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
               }
          }

          ```
6. Backup current SQLite database by entering the following into the CLI:
     ```
     ./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
     ```
7. Login into your Heroku CLI using: 
     ```
     heroku login -i
     ```
8. Migrate models to the new Postgres database:
     ```
     python manage.py makemigrations
     ```
     ```
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
9. A new `superuser` will needed to be created to gain access to the Django Admin Page and can be created using the following commands in the CLI terminal:
     ```
     python3 manage.py createsuperuser
     ```
10. Reload the data into the new database using the folowing:
     ```
     ./manage.py loaddata db.json
     ```
11. Temporarily disable `COLLECTSTATIC` to prevent Heroku from collecting static files until they have been set up on AWS:
     ```
     heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <your app name>
     ```
     *`--app` command is necessary if you have more than one heroku apps*
12. Add Heroku to the `ALLOWED HOSTS` varible in `settings.py`: 
     ```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1',
                      '<your app name>.herokuapp.com',
                      'localhost']
     ```
13. Push these changes to Github:
     ```
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m "Commit Message"
     $ git push
     ```
14. Set up push to Heroku:
     ```
     heroku git:remote -a <your app name>
     ```
15. Push to Heroku:
     ```
     git push heroku main
     ```

Heroku will receive the pushed code from the GitHub repository and host the application with the required packages set out. 

The deployed version can now be viewed by selecting `View App` in the top-right of the page.

          AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

          # Static and media files
          STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
          STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
          DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
          MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

          # Override static and media URLs in production
          STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
          MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
     ```
5. Create a `custom_storages.py` file in your project's root directory. Inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations:
     ```
     from django.conf import settings
     from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

     class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
     location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

     class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
     location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
     ```
6. Delete `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from your Heroku Config Variables
7. Push these changes to Github:
     ```
     $ git add .
     $ git commit -m "Commit Message"
     $ git push
     ```

<div align='center'>
<h2><span style='font-size:20px;'>&#127882;</span> Congrats! <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#127882;</span> </h2>
<h4>Your project is ready to use. Have fun!</h4>

## Credits 
The developer consulted multiple sites and multiple other Code Institute students in order to better understand the code they needed to implement their application. 

The [Code Institute Boutique Ado Mini Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) was used as a reference point for the developer in the development of the core functionality of the website. The lessons included with the mini-project helped the developer to get a better understanding of each functionality and how to customise it to suit their project.

Code Institute students Rebecca Tracey and Ciaran Concannon's final projects
- [Delphin Lifesaving Club](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/delphin_lifesavingclub/ "Delphin Lifesaving Club")
- [Rhythm Box](https://github.com/cjcon90/the_rhythm_box "Delphin Lifesaving Club")

For code that was copied and edited, the developer made sure to reference this within the code. The following sites were used on a more regular basis:
- [Coding with Mitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeRC7E8Z7Y "Coding with Mitch Tutorials")
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Link to BootStrap page")
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/ "Link to Stack Overflow page")
