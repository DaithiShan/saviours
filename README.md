### Development Planes

In order to design and create the application, the developer distinguished the required functionality of the site and how it would answer the user stories, as described above, using the **Five Development Planes**:

<strong>3. <u>Structure</u></strong>

The website's navigation was organized in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results: 


<div align='center'align='center'>
<strong>Navigation Structure for User Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/user-mgmt-ia.png" alt="User Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<div align='center'align='center'>
<strong>Navigation Structure for Product Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/product-mgmt-ia.png" alt="Product Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<div align='center'align='center'>
<strong>Navigation Structure for Transaction Management:</strong>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/transaction-mgmt-ia.png" alt="Transaction Management Information Architecture" />
</div>

<strong>4. <u>Skeleton</u></strong>

Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/h1ntD5dJMvQHQBXjngttOe/St-Saviours-OBA "Link to St Saviours OBA Workspace") with providing a positive user experience in mind:

<strong>5. <u>Surface</u></strong>

- <strong>Colour Scheme</strong>

     - The chosen colour scheme was specifically selected to match our colors at St Saviours OBA. Black and yellow are our primary colours, their clash represents the combatitve nature of the sport.

     - The indigo, purple and heliotrope are used to provide user feedback in relation to the shopping cart feature and payment system.

<div align='center'>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/st-saviours-oba-cp.png" alt="St Saviours OBA Colour Palette" />
</div>

- <strong>Typography</strong>

     - The primary font for this website is [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald "Link to Oswald Google Fonts page"). It was chosen for its old-school, classic look which fits St Saviours OBA as an old, inner city boxing club.

          ![Oswald Typography Example](markdown-files/readme-files/oswald.png)

     - The secondary font used is [Playball](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playball "Link to Playball Google Fonts page"). It's a similar old-school font with more overt sporty overtones, and works really well for headings and titles.

          ![Playball Typography Example](markdown-files/readme-files/playball.png)


- <strong>Imagery</strong>

     - The imagery used on this web app was purchased from [Canva](https://canva.com/ "Link to Canva") by the developer using a Canva Pro License, or provided to the developer by St Saviours OBA eg. the logo below

     ![St Saviours OBA Logo](markdown-files/readme-files/logo.png)

- <strong>Icons</strong>

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the source of all icons used throughout this web app.

## Information Architecture

### Database
- During development, a single-database was setup using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html "Link to SQLite site") as this is included and did not require any further installation to support.
- Upon deployment, [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres "Link to Heroku Postgres site") was used, as this is an add-on service provided by Heroku.

### Data Models
<div align='center'>
<img src="markdown-files/readme-files/models.png" alt="Lato Typography" />
</div>

*model diagram created using [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/ "DrawSQL page")*

Unless otherwise stated, the default validation settings of `blank=False, null=False` are assumed.

#### User Model

For this app I created a custom User Model following [this guide in the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-a-custom-user-model) and [this tutorial by CodingWithMitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeRC7E8Z7Y).

This made it easy to add custom user fields, and have login based on email as opposed to an unneccessary username being used within model

#### Accounts App

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the St Saviours OBA website features a consistently responsive and intuitive naviational system:

#### Navbar
- Users will find a **navbar** conventionally placed on the top of each page. Navigational links are identifiable and accessible, and the club logo redirects users to the home page.
- The navbar utilises **dropdown** menus for cleaner design.
- An **`active`** class provides clear user feedback on their current location in the dropdown menus.
- If the user is in session, an additional dropdown menu provides users with account functionality.
- On mobile and tablet devices, the navigation menu collapses into a **hamburger** menu on top left for a cleaner design.
- The shopping cart icon to top right is designed quick and convenient access to items selected for secure checked out.
- **Toasts** are displayed under the navbar, providing users with realtime feedback on their actions.

#### Footer
- The **footer** contains links for users to navigate to their preferred location with ease.
- The links are divided into appropriate categories, allowing users to choose precisely where they'd like to visit, and displaying the extent of options available to them.
- These links are displayed in four columns on large and medium devices, and single columns on small.
- The footer also provides the Club **social links** and **copyright** information.
     - Link to Club Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok.
     - Mailto link to club emails

#### Page Layout

- A banner title is provided on each page to help users to quickly determine their location
- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/ "Link to Jinja docs") was used to extend the base.html page, allowing for the utmost consistency and preservation of functionality across all pages. The extended block elements created the same basic layout for each page:

     ```
     <nav>
          <!-- Navigational content -->
     </nav>

     {% block messages %}
          <!-- Appropriate toast messages -->
     {% endblock %}

     {% block content %}
          <!-- Content unique to each page -->
     {% endblock %}

     <footer>
          <!-- Footer content -->
     </footer>
     ```
